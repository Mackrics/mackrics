# # Hello there,


- I'm a quantitative analyst, primarily writing R code, but I also enjoy writing
  some Lua for Neovim or a command line app in golang.
- I have a personal blog, [mackrics.com](https://mackrics.com), written using
  the scientific typesetting system [Quarto](https://quarto). You can also follow me on
  mastodon [@mackrics@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@mackrics).
- If you want to chat you can email me at [hello@mackrics.com](mailto:hello@mackrics.com).
